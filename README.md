# Building & Running
In order to build this project, you will need Docker Compose. On Windows, Docker Compose comes with Docker Engine. On Linux, Docker Compose can be installed manually via command line: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

First, create a .env file and place it into the wtm-express.

In order to start the entire project, run `docker compose up --build -d` in the `SWE-Fall24` directory. This should start up the `wtm-mongodb`, `wtm-react`, `wtm-express` containers, and a network between them. 

## Starting the Back-End Locally:
- Make sure you have the database container running: `docker compose up wtm-mongodb -d`
- In `SWE-Fall24/wtm-express`, run `npm i`.
- Run `npm start`.
- Back-end test cases can be run with the command `npm test` while in `SWE-Fall24/wtm-express`.

## Starting the Front-End Locally:
- In `SWE-Fall24/wtm-react`, run `npm i`.
- Run `npm start`.
